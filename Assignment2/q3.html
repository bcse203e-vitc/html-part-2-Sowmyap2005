        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am Sowmya, currently studying in the Department of Computer Science at VIT University in Chennai. I have completed an internship with ISACA, where I gained valuable insights into cybersecurity and IT governance. Last year, I participated in the Smart India Hackathon, where I had the opportunity to showcase my problem-solving and technical skills. This year, I took part in a Breakathon organized by IEEE, where I learned a lot about machine learning. The experience was truly mind-blowing, as it deepened my understanding of the field and inspired me to explore its vast potential further. These experiences have greatly contributed to my growth and passion for technology.</p>
        <aside>
            <p>I am a passionate singer, and I have been learning Carnatic vocal music for the past 10 years. Music is something that brings me immense joy and serves as an expression of my emotions. Apart from music, I have a deep interest in drawing, which allows me to unleash my creativity and explore different forms of art. On occasion, I also enjoy cooking, as it gives me a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction when I experiment with new recipes and flavors. These hobbies are an essential part of my life, helping me unwind and stay balanced while pursuing my academic and professional goals.
